# Assignment

The assignment consisted in learning about how to:

1. Architect components in React
2. Deal with hooks like useEffect. I also used Context and made some custom hooks to make things more tidy.
3. Deal with very intricate state management: keeping track of inputs, updating score, checking various conditions, adding conditionnal rendering, etc.

# Scope

Because of the amount of time I had to create this project, I did not include much media queries and layout adaptations.
