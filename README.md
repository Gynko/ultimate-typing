# Assignment

The assignment consisted in learning about how to architect components in React, and dealing with very intricate state management: keeping track of inputs, updating score, checking various conditions, adding conditionnal rendering, etc.

# Scope

Because of the amount of time I had to create this project, I did not include much media queries and layout adaptations.
